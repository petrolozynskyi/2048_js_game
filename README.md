# 2048 JavaScript Game

This is a single-player puzzle game implemented using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The objective is to combine numbered tiles on a grid to reach the number 2048.

# Technologies Used:

- HTML: Provides the basic structure of the game board and tiles.
- CSS: Styles the game board, tiles, and text elements to create a visually appealing interface.
- JavaScript: Handles the core game logic, including:
- Generating new tiles with random values (2 or 4).
- Detecting user input (arrow keys).
- Moving tiles in the specified direction (up, down, left, right).
- Combining tiles with the same value when they collide.
- Checking for game-over conditions (no empty cells and no possible merges).
- Keeping track of the score.
